## How to setup this project?
It's pretty simple! All you have to do is clone this repo in your local machine, then run the following command once you have a terminal at the project's location:
```
npm install
```

Once npm is done installing all of the dependencies, you can run this command to view to project in a web browser:
```
npm run serve
```

And then open in your browser the following page


[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

And that's it! If you have any questions or something broke or isn't running correctly feel free to contact me:
